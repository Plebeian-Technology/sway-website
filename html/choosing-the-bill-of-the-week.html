            <h1>Choosing the Sway Bill of the Week</h1>
            <p>
                Choosing a Bill of the Week can be a difficult process.
                Sometimes the Bill of the Week is an obvious choice; an issue
                gains momentum, inspires public debate and the legislator
                creates and votes on a bill. However, this does not happen that
                often; typically Sway will rely on an imperfect process to
                decide which bill should be Bill of the Week.
            </p>

            <p>
                When choosing a Bill of the Week, Sway considers a few
                factors:
            </p>

            <ol class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    1. Diversity. The Sway platform should provide to its
                    users a diversity of bills that can be voted on. For
                    example, police reform is a popular topic in Baltimore City,
                    and Sway will feature legislation on reforming the
                    Baltimore City Police Department. However, police reform
                    cannot be the only issue Sway covers and it would be rare
                    for a specific category of legislation to be Bill of the
                    Week more than one week in a row.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    2. Cost. Swaylation that results in large spending
                    increases, such as
                    <a
                        href="https://baltimore.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4617862&GUID=69D25623-AAAE-4B76-8ACA-EDCCEBB6362D&Options=ID|Text|Attachments|Other|&Search=20-0588"
                        >Bill 20-0588</a
                    >
                    from the 2020 Baltimore City Council which approved a $105
                    million bond issuance for the redevelopment of the
                    Perkins-Somerset-Oldtown area of East Baltimore. An
                    exception to this rule are regular and broad spending bills
                    such the annual budget, because:
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    3. Focused. Sway only considers legislation that is
                    targeted on issues. A broad budget bill is not targeted in
                    the same way a bill that, for example, deals with spending
                    money to provide low-income housing is focused on the
                    specific issue of housing.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    4. Impactful. This is the final criterion that Sway
                    considers. The Baltimore City Council considers many bills
                    that may be impactful in a hyperlocal setting, such as the
                    demolition of some row homes, however, such an ordinance
                    would have little impact on Baltimore City as a whole.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Even given the criteria above, determing which bill should be
                Bill of the Week can be no easy task. Some people will
                undoubtedly be disappointed on a given week when multiple pieces
                of legislation are deserving of the Bill of the Week title. One
                way in which Sway can rememdy this is by selecting bills that
                may be past their peak popularity. For example, if a bill is not
                selected one week, it may be selected the next, or during a slow
                period such as around July 4th or the holidays at the end of the
                year.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, Sway may, at some points, re-issue a bill as the
                Bill of the Week. This is most likely to occur during the
                aforementioned slow periods, when the City Council has not voted
                on any new legislation.
