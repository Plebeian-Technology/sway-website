            <h1>Welcome to the Sway Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>
                Below we are going to outline how we collect information from
                you and what we do with it.
            </p>
            <h3>How does Sway collect information from me?</h3>
            <p>
                When you use Sway, we collect information that you enter and
                store it in a database on the Google Firebase platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you would like to view this information, please schedule a
                privacy walkthrough by clicking the Support
                <strong>?</strong> bubble in the bottom-right corner of the Sway
                app at <a href="sway.vote">sway.vote</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>What does Sway do with my information?</h3>
            <p>
                Information you enter into Sway is only used for presenting your
                information back to you such as displaying what legislation you
                have voted on and how you compare to your reprensentatives
                through a Sway Score.
            </p>
            <h3>What information does Sway collect?</h3>
            <p>
                We only collect information you give us. We do
                <strong>not</strong> collect analytics on how you use Sway and
                we do not show ads.
            </p>
            <h3>Does Sway sell my data?</h3>
            <p>No.</p>
            <h3>Will Sway ever sell my data?</h3>
            <p>
                Sway will not. However, with your explicit permission, we may
                offer a feature where you can sell your data in the future to
                interested parties. We would likely take a small percentage of
                any proceeds.
            </p>
            <h3>Can I delete my Sway account?</h3>
            <p>
                You may request an account deletion by emailing sway@sway.vote
                or during a privacy webinar.
            </p>
            <h3>How do I know you're being honest?</h3>
            <p>
                Sway offers privacy webinar/walkthroughs over video chat where
                we can show you what the Sway application and database looks
                like. If you attend a webinar and give us permission to view it,
                we can show you your account data.
            </p>
