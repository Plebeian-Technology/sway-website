            <h1>Welcome to the Sway Organization Content Policy</h1>
            <p>
                Sway strives to adhere to the Code of Practice as set out by the
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fourthestate.org"
                    >Fourth Estate</a
                >, an institution which promotes best practices in journalism
                and media reporting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because the statements from organizations will appear on the
                Sway platform, Sway expects organizations to follow this content
                policy as closely as possible.
            </p>
            <p>As such, Sway will vet statements to ensure they are:</p>
            <h3>1. Truthful</h3>
            <p>
                We understand that legislation can be complex. Supporting
                evidence of a position may therefore exist in a gray area.
                However, any evidence added to support one's position should be
                verifiable and not blatantly inaccurate or false. To clarify,
                any evidence presented to support a position should pass the
                <a
                    target="_blank"
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_test"
                    >Duck Test</a
                >
                or the
                <a
                    target="_blank"
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_test#Elephant_test"
                    >Elephant Test.</a
                >
            </p>
            <h3>2. Relevant</h3>
            <p>
                Statements should be relevant to the piece of legislation in
                question. For example, if Council Ordinance 123 is about
                providing money for roads, statements should be about roads
                and/or transit. If a statement is off-topic (e.g., gun violence
                in Baltimore City), that statement would not be accepted.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Civil</h3>
            <p>
                Please keep your statements civil and free of profanity,
                attacks, sexual language, explicit or implicit racist or
                xenophobic language, or broad generalizations about groups of
                people that may be construed as offensive. Don't be a jerk.
            </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                We realize the above guidelines may seem overly broad, however,
                that's kind of the point - we would like to leave your
                statements up to you. If we discover something in your statement
                that we believe violates one of the principles above we will
                work with you to revise it and get the statement onto our
                platform.
            </p>
